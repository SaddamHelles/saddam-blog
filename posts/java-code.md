Java powers the web - it's **the** most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int time = 22;
    if (time < 10) {
      System.out.println("Good morning.");
    } else if (time < 18) {
      System.out.println("Good day.");
    }  else {
      System.out.println("Good evening.");
    }
  }
}
```
